<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>List of tasks:</strong></span></p>
<p>1.You will be given a data set (from Ruter). Please do the following on this data set:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify 5 features from this data set and apply feature engineering on them in Python</li>
<li>Make atleast 5 data visualization using various python packages.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.You will be given access to <a href="http://www.bineric.com/">www.bineric.com</a> This is an external data labeling site. You will have to label some data.<br />Instructions on using Bineric:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign up using your university email address</li>
<li>We have estimated that the data labeling should not take more than 30 minutes.</li>
<li>This is an easy part of the assignment. The goal here is to give you an idea on how data labeling is done in real life.</li>
<li>The task assignment (Covid19 data labeling: From a set of images identify the infected images) is meant to show you how AI is used in health. This is a harder task to solve, since only health people diagnose and label Xrays. Therefore its not important that you get the right result for this data set. The important thing is that you go through the data set and get an idea on how data labeling is done practically in health.</li>
<li>Bineric is a beta site. You might see some bugs. In case of bugs, send an email to me and I will fix it.</li>
</ul>
