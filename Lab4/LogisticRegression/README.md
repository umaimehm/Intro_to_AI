# Lab4_LogisticRegression

### What is Logistic regression in python? <br> 
It is a technique to analyse a data-set which has a dependent variable and one or more independent variables to predict the outcome in a binary variable, meaning it will have only two outcomes. <br>
Example- <br>
yes or no <br>
1 or 0 <br>
True or False <br>

### Use Cases

Following are the use cases where we can use logistic regression.

1. Weather Prediction
   Weather predictions are the result of logical regression.
   Here, we analyse the data of the previous weather reports and predict the possible outcome for a specific day.
   But logical regression would only predict categorical data, like if its going to rain or not.

2. Determining Illness is also one of the use cases used in logical regression. 


Dependent variable - target variable <br>
Independent variables -  predictors <br>


### Steps for logistic regression:

1. Collecting Data                                                   
2. Analyzing Data                                         
3. Data Wrangling
4. Train and Test                      
5. Accuracy Report


### In this Lab Guide, you will find two tasks:
### 1. Task 1:<br>
This task shows you how to implement Logictic Regression.
Implemention of Logistic Regression using Titanic_Survival.csv dataset. The dataset is already provided on GitHub. <br>
1. Titanic_LogisticRegression.ipynb - It contains all the code for implementing Logistic Regression on Titanic Dataset. <br>
2. LogisticRegression_Titanic_Dataset.mp4 - The detailed tutorial video explaning the above dataset and how to perform LogisticRegression.<br>


### 2. Task 2: <br>
Try to implement Logistic Regression on the Suvdata dataset taking reference from Task 1.  

### Question : You have to find out what factors made people more interested in buying SUV?
