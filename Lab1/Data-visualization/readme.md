# Lab-Prep-1-Data Visualization Using Python

#In this Lab, we will use two datasets which are freely available.The Iris and Wine Reviews dataset.

You can download the two datasets from the link provided below:

Irsi Dataset - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris

Wine-Review Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews 

Data Visualization in Python can be done using different libraries. Here we have used three Python Libraries namely Pandas Visualization, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Here you will find three jupyter notebooks:
1. Pandas_Visualization.ipynb
2. Matplotlib.ipynb
3. Seaborn.ipynb
